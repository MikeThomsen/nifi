<!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
    This processor is a record-aware processor for inserting data into MongoDB. It uses a configured record reader and
    schema to read an incoming record set from the body of a flowfile and then inserts batches of those records into
    a configured MongoDB collection.
</p>
<p>
    This processor does not support updates, deletes or upserts. The number of documents to insert at a time is controlled
    by the <em>Insert Batch Size</em> configuration property. This value should be set to a reasonable size to ensure
    that MongoDB is not overloaded with too many inserts at once.
