<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
    This client service configures a remote connection/traversal and allows a script to execute operations against it. The key
    difference between this and GremlinClientService is that this version does not run the script on the Gremlin Server, but rather on
    the client side (NiFi). For more details, see the Tinkerpop documentation
    <a href="https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/tutorials/gremlin-language-variants/">here</a>. It goes into detail about
    how Gremlin bytecode and language variants work.
</p>
<p>
    This client service will cache your scripts and generate compiled Groovy code from them. For this reason, all scripts should be
    parameterized.
